# SciProg
Scientific Programming department of Computing in Science Engineering, a publication of the IEEE Computer Society

## Scope

The Scientific Programming department publishes short articles on all
 aspects of writing code for doing research, ranging from the small code
 of everyday research (scripts, notebooks, workflows) to large HPC
 applications. Suitable topics include, but are not limited to, software
 architecture and design, development methodology, social aspects of code
 development, and software tools for research. Articles must, however, be
 of interest to scientists and research software engineers from a wide
 range of scientific disciplines.
